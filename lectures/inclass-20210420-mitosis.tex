\begin{questions}
\question[5] Imagine you are the first biologist to construct a microscope and observe mitosis. Watch the video provided by your instructor, and then sketch your findings and observations. 
\begin{parts}
\part Be clear and do your best to draw a fair representation of what you see, so you can get credit for your discoveries. 
\part Do you see any phases, patterns, or significant events that are noteworthy?
\end{parts}

\question[5] Now also imagine you are making a nature show. Below your sketches and observations, write some brief ``copy'' / scripts / storyboarding that you would imagine a nature show host\footnote{old British guy; crikey Australian guy or his daughter; Canadian twins, etc go crazy} saying as the video unfolds. Your goal here is to make your findings understandable to a general audience\footnote{say science-interested high school students}. \textbf{Special recognition for those willing to act out their scripts.}
